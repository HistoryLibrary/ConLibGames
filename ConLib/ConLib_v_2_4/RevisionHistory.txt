                                 Version 2.4
                         (released August 14, 2002)

-- added macros for more keyboard support:
   *) ConLibGetAsciiKeyCode
   *) ConLibCheckControlKey
   *) ConLibGetVirtualKeyCode

-- several functions were changed from using row/column arguments to using X/Y
   arguments instead in order to make all size information consistent
   throughout the library. These functions are:
   *) ConLibInitialize
   *) ConLibGetWinSize
   *) ConLibSetWinSize

-- added the ConLibShowCursor function

-- added the ConLibIsNT function

-- fixed Win2000 bug so that the handling of mouse events is enabled

                                 Version 2.3
                         (released April 14, 2001)

-- Added defined color constants to ConLib.h

-- Added ConLibFlushInputRecords; this function removes any input records from
   the standard input console's buffer.

-- Enhanced the display of ConLib debug information so that system-defined
   error strings are displayed.

-- Fixed bug in ConLibReadString; if the caller did not provide a buffer large
   enough to store text entered from the console, the string was
   null-terminated and last two characters were thrown away on the assumption
   they were a CR-LF pair.  Now the function checks the last two characters
   read; if they are not a CR-LF pair, the string is null-terminated and any
   remaining text left on the input stream if flushed.

                                 Version 2.2
                         (released October 29, 2000)

-- fixed bug in ConLibMouseButtonPressed; the function was detecting mouse
   wheel and movement events and mapping them to "button pressed" events; now
   the if a mouse wheel or movement event occurs, this function will return
   a value of NO_MOUSE_BUTTON_PRESSED.

                                 Version 2.1
                         (released October 4, 2000)

-- changed prototype for ConLibGetTextColor so that it now takes pointers to
   the foreground and background colors (freeing the caller from having to
   perform any bitwise manipulation)

                                 Version 2.0
                         (released October 1, 2000)

-- added ConLibInitialize, which is now necessary to initialize the ConLib
   library; it establishes the initial console screen size and allocates
   internal screen handles

-- added "ConLibCheckMouse" event macros

-- added ConLibCopyBufferToScreen and ConLibCopyScreenToBuffer to allow more
   control of reading/writing portions of the console window

-- added GetEventType so the caller can quickly determine the type of event
   associated with an INPUT_RECORD

-- added ConLibPauseDisplay so the caller can temporarily suspend updating of
   the screen while drawing complex graphics

-- added ConLibSetScreenColor, which allows the caller to set the foreground
   and background colors for the entire console window

-- separate versions for Win9x and NT are no longer supplied, a single set of
   libraries should work for both platforms (however, single and multi
   threaded versions are still supported)

                                 Version 1.2.1

-- Modified ConLibMouseButtonPressed so that a right or left mouse button
   event is returned only if the mouse is not currently moving or "wheeled".
   Also, the caller can now test for double-clicks.

-- This build does not contain the NT versions of the libraries; those will
   soon be available in v1.3.

                                 Version 1.2

-- Added stdlib.h to ConLib.h so that the FILE data type is recognized from
   C++ modules.

-- Fixed bug: ConLibSetTextColor had no effect on ConLibDrawCol

-- The prototype for ConLibReadInputRecord in ConLib.h indicated that the
   return type was a BOOL.  This is incorrect, it should really be an INT
   since the return value is used to detect the type of input record that was
   read from the console's input buffer.

                                 Version 1.1

-- Added "ConLibReadInputRecord", which allows processing of keyboard and mouse
   events.  Also added the enumerated "INPUT_REC" values to the header file so
   the type of event read from the console's input queue can be determined.

-- Added "ConLibMouseButtonPressed" so mouse button clicks can be detected; this
   function supports either left or right button detection.

-- Changed "ConLibEnableMessageDisplay" to "ConLibEnableDebugInfo" to better
   communicate its purpose.

-- Made "ConLibWriteDebugMessage" static to the ConLib.c module (can't see any
   reason for the client to have access to this function).

-- Added "ConLibGetMouseRecCoords" so X/Y coordinates of a mouse input record
   can conveniently be determined.
